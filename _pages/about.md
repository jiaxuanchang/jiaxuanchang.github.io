I am a PhD candidate working with Prof. Jody M. Klymak on a project titled "Fjord Topography and Tides: The Impact of Tidal Forcings and Headlands on Internal Tides Energetics." My research focuses on the dynamics of internal waves and their impact on large-scale ocean currents, aiming to improve the parameterization of small-scale mixing in global models.

Currently, I have submitted my first paper and am in the final stages of my PhD degree. I am passionate about expanding our understanding of internal wave dynamics and their implications for large-scale ocean modeling. If you have postdoctoral opportunities or potential collaborations in this field, please feel free to contact me.
